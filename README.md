# Week2 Weekend Assignment:

### Description:
  - A SQL infused application that allows you to see a list of 'celebrities'.
  - It splits the database into 3 catagories of celebs and lets you view each section individually
  - Each of these are queried dynamically and there is a Recycler view that dynamically shows the list of Celebrities that you get back from the list.
  - This is also supported with a DetailedView to get a closer look at the descriptions of each Celebrity.
